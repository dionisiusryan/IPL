# IPL Management System - Property Service Charge Application

An internal web application designed to manage and automate the billing process for residential maintenance fees (IPL - Iuran Pemeliharaan Lingkungan). Developed during my time at a Property Developer (PT MR), this system replaced manual spreadsheets and streamlined the workflow for the finance and administrative teams.

The primary goal was to improve efficiency, reduce human error, and provide clear financial reporting for property management.
